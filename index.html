            </header>
            <p>こんにちは！Hello! My name is Alex Wood, a 21-year-old student currently enrolled at Pomona College, majoring in Computer Science. I was born in Aomori, Japan, on an Air Force base, and grew up in the Pacific Northwest since the age of 3. I am located in Ridgefield, Washington.
                At school, I participate in Pomona-Pitzer D-III Varsity Football Team and also serve as the Treasurer for Shogo Taiko, a Japanese drumming group. I'm deeply interested and have delved into various aspects of Computer Science, including Software Development, IT, AI, and Data Science. I am pursuing a career in one of these fields.
                I believe in working as a team, fostering clear communication, maintaining a positive environment, and working diligently to achieve goals while continuously exploring new ideas and approaches. Please feel free to reach out; my contact information is provided at the bottom of the page!</p>

                Since I can remember, I have done a variety of sports growing up: football, track, baseball, 
                and basketball. However, the one sport that I truly invested most of my time and dedication 
                in was football. There, I found a community and environment unlike any other, where I learned 
                what true discipline, hard work, and teamwork are, with a group of 100+ all striving to win a 
                game of football. In high school, a coach once told me, "Football is a privilege, and it has 
                given me what I have today, so I owe football. Play the game to give back for all that it has given you."
            </p>
            <p>
                This ideal stuck with me throughout high school and led me to the decision to pursue the 
                sport inter-collegiately. Now, I play for the Pomona-Pitzer Varsity football team as a DB! 
                Currently, I am in the off-season, preparing for my final year of football and my final year 
                of competitive football ever!

            <p>I remember playing an arcade game called "Taijutsu no Taiko" and always had a fascination with 
                Japanese drums. Once I heard about the "Shogo Taiko" club, I went to the first practice of the 
                semester and enjoyed the sound, movement, and collaboration that came with it. Through this, I 
                was able to explore aspects of my culture I had never thought of, as well as having a great group 
                of members where we coordinated to play the Taiko drums through various songs. Now, I hold the 
                position of Treasurer and will have my last few performances before graduating in December!
